      <h2>1.Brain Tumor Detection using ML & DL</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on accurate brain tumor detection from MRI scans using a hybrid approach that combines image preprocessing, deep learning (EfficientNetB7, MobileNetV2, Xception, InceptionV3), and XGBoost classification. It achieves high accuracy and reliability across custom and public datasets using a unified feature representation.

      <h2>2.console-based Train Booking System</h2>
      <p>
        This is a Java-based console application that simulates a basic Train Booking System. It allows users to view train schedules, book and cancel tickets, and for admins to add trains and view all bookings. The system is fully object-oriented and uses separate classes to manage users, trains, and bookings.
